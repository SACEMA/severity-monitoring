# Synthetic data scenarios
All data scenarios describe two strains, one of which is exponentially decaying
and being replaced with the other, which is exponentially growing. This phenomenon
is meant to represent the SARS-COV-2 beta to omicron strain evolution. 

Below, we describe each scenario, representing a change in an underlying process:
severity, detection of primary outcomes, and mortality.


## Scenario 1 (True negative)
This scenario describes a situation where there is no change in severity.

## Scenario 2 (False positive)
This scenario describes a situation where there is a decrease in dectection of primary outcomes.

## Scenario 3 (True positive downward)
This scenario describes a situation where there is a relative decrease in mortality.

## Scenario 4 (True positive upward)
This scenario describes a situation where there is a relative increase in mortality.

## Scenario 5 (False negative)
This scenario describes a situation where there is relatively higher severity and a higher detection of
primary outcomes.
