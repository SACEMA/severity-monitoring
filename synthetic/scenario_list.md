# Synthetic data scenarios
The synthetic data scenarios represented here form part of the evaluation framework of the tool. Each scenario represents an expected true or false change/no-change situation, which we expect the tool to detect.

All the data scenarios describe two interacting strains, one of which is exponentially decaying
and being replaced with another, which is exponentially growing. The scenarios are characterized by one or more relative changes in severity, detection of primary outcomes, and mortality.

An example of this phenomenon is the gradual replacement of the SARS-COV-2 beta variant by the omicron variant.


## Scenario 1 (True negative)
No change in severity.

## Scenario 2 (False positive)
A decrease in detection of primary outcomes.

## Scenario 3 (True positive downward)
A decrease in mortality.

## Scenario 4 (True positive upward)
An increase in mortality.

## Scenario 5 (False negative)
A higher severity and primary outcome detection.
